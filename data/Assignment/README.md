What are the most used paths in emergency situations (fire, etc.)?
There are doors/hops which only allows 10 people to pass through

### Optimize WiFi Access Point placement
Analyse where people are and find optimal positions for the router according to the movement distribution.

## Mobility
The mobility of the students is defined by the lectures or tutorials they attend throughout
the day. Normally the lectures and tutorials are fitted into 2 hours slots.
During the lecture/tutorials slots the students stay in one lecture hall/room. In between these 2 hours
slots students move to other locations within the build (to study, to other lectures or finally to go home).
